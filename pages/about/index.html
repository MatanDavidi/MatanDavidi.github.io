                            <p>I attended primary school in Cassarate, and immediately afterwards middle school in Lugano 1.</p>
                            <p>
                                Given my keen interest in information technology from an early age (see the "Personal history" section), 
                                I enrolled in the Vocational secondary school of Trevano-Canobbio, where I learned programming languages like 
                                <span class="standout">Java</span> and <span class="standout">C#</span>, <span class="standout">web development</span>, 
                                <span class="standout">database management</span>, and network and server configuration.
                                In my spare time I explored Python and Unreal Engine, working on projects like 
                                <a href="https://github.com/i3devs/GoogleTranslateDestroyer">GoogleTranslateDestroyer</a> 
                                and <a href="../portfolio/projects/cameriere/">Cameriere</a>.

                            <p>
                                My initial studies in computer science ignited a passion for the field, 
                                prompting me to aim for enrollment at ETH Zürich for a deeper understanding.
                                In 2021, I enrolled in their Computer Science bachelor's program, excited to 
                                learn from esteemed professors and fully immerse myself in high-quality education, 
                                and I am now close to graduating as of August 2024.

                                Given my keen interest in information technology from an early age (see the "Personal history" section), 
                                I decided not to take a high school diploma, but rather to start studying information technology at the
                                Vocational secondary school of Trevano-Canobbio, where I learned to programme for desktops (<span class="standout">Java</span> and <span class="standout">C#</span>), 
                                for the <span class="standout">web</span> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP), 
                                manage data and databases (<span class="standout">SQL</span>), configure company servers (AD, LDAP, DHCP, DNS, group policies, etc. ), 
                                configure corporate networks, and above all design and implement individual and group projects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, in my spare time I learned to take my first steps with Python 
                                (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/i3devs/GoogleTranslateDestroyer">GoogleTranslateDestroyer</a>, 
                                where I used <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and 
                                <a href="https://github.com/mouuff/mtranslate">mouuff / mtranslate</a>) and Unreal Engine 
                                (see <a href="../portfolio/projects/cameriere/">Cameriere</a>).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Studying computer science for the first time was an amazing experience! 
                                It opened up a whole new world of knowledge and possibilities that I hadn't been 
                                aware of before, and I was so happy to be learning something I was passionate about! 
                                But it was more than that. I was beginning to see the actual scope of the field, and it made me want to know more. Much more! 
                                I realised that just studying computer science would not be enough for me: I wanted to know as much about it as humanely possible, 
                                so I set my sights on the best institution I could realistically enrol in: ETH Zürich.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After graduating from the vocational secondary school with the Diploma of Vocational Education and Training 
                                (what in German would be known as an EFZ, or "Eidgenössisches Fähigkeitszeugnis") and the Technical
                                Vocational Baccalaureate ("Berufsmatura" in German), however, one last obstacle appeared before the enrolment.
                                As I had graduated from a technical secondary school and not a regular high school, I could not enrol directly, 
                                and thus I would have either had to pass some entrance exams, or follow a one-year Bridge course ("Passerelle-Kurs" in German). 
                                I opted for the latter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, in 2021, I enrolled into the Computer Science bachelor course of study at ETH Zürich, and I was beyond excited. 
                                I found an apartment, packed my bags, and moved to the canton of Zürich, and was beside myself throughout the entire experience.
                                <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?feature=shared">Ask my parents</a>: from day one I was ecstatic to be able to partake in the highest 
                                quality computer science education available in Switzerland, taught by professors who made significant contributions to the subject of 
                                their class (some of them even covering what they themselves discovered <span style="text-wrap: nowrap;">（ ๑✧∀✧๑ ）</span>).
                                Not without struggles and off-days, I worked diligently and always gave it my best, so even if I ended up failing, I'd have no regrets looking back, 
                                and three years later, as I'm writing this in August 2024, I am close enough to graduating that I can taste it, and it tastes like Rösti and Pastetli.
