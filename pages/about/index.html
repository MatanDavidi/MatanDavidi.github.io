                            <p>I attended primary school in Cassarate, and immediately afterwards middle school in Lugano 1.</p>
                            <p>
                                Given my keen interest in information technology from an early age (see the "Personal history" section), 
                                I enrolled in the Vocational secondary school of Trevano-Canobbio, where I learned programming languages like 
                                <span class="standout">Java</span> and <span class="standout">C#</span>, <span class="standout">web development</span>, 
                                <span class="standout">database management</span>, and network and server configuration.
                                In my spare time I explored Python and Unreal Engine, working on projects like 
                                <a href="https://github.com/i3devs/GoogleTranslateDestroyer">GoogleTranslateDestroyer</a> 
                                and <a href="../portfolio/projects/cameriere/">Cameriere</a>.

                            <p>
                                My initial studies in computer science ignited a passion for the field, 
                                prompting me to aim for enrollment at ETH Zürich for a deeper understanding.
                                In 2021, I enrolled in their Computer Science bachelor's program, excited to 
                                learn from esteemed professors and fully immerse myself in high-quality education, 
                                and I am now close to graduating as of August 2024.

                                Given my keen interest in information technology from an early age (see the "Personal history" section), 
                                I decided not to take a high school diploma, but rather to start studying information technology at the
                                Vocational secondary school of Trevano-Canobbio, where I learned to programme for desktops (<span class="standout">Java</span> and <span class="standout">C#</span>), 
                                for the <span class="standout">web</span> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP), 
                                manage data and databases (<span class="standout">SQL</span>), configure company servers (AD, LDAP, DHCP, DNS, group policies, etc. ), 
                                configure corporate networks, and above all design and implement individual and group projects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, in my spare time I learned to take my first steps with Python 
                                (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/i3devs/GoogleTranslateDestroyer">GoogleTranslateDestroyer</a>, 
                                where I used <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and 
                                <a href="https://github.com/mouuff/mtranslate">mouuff / mtranslate</a>) and Unreal Engine 
                                (see <a href="../portfolio/projects/cameriere/">Cameriere</a>).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Studying computer science for the first time was an amazing experience! 
                                It opened up a whole new world of knowledge and possibilities that I hadn't been 
                                aware of before, and I was so happy to be learning something I was passionate about! 
                                But it was more than that. I was beginning to see the actual scope of the field, and it made me want to know more. Much more! 
                                I realised that just studying computer science would not be enough for me: I wanted to know as much about it as humanely possible, 
                                so I set my sights on the best institution I could realistically enrol in: ETH Zürich.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After graduating from the vocational secondary school with the Diploma of Vocational Education and Training 
                                (what in German would be known as an EFZ, or "Eidgenössisches Fähigkeitszeugnis") and the Technical
                                Vocational Baccalaureate ("Berufsmatura" in German), however, one last obstacle appeared before the enrolment.
                                As I had graduated from a technical secondary school and not a regular high school, I could not enrol directly, 
                                and thus I would have either had to pass some entrance exams, or follow a one-year Bridge course ("Passerelle-Kurs" in German). 
                                I opted for the latter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, in 2021, I enrolled into the Computer Science bachelor course of study at ETH Zürich, and I was beyond excited. 
                                I found an apartment, packed my bags, and moved to the canton of Zürich, and was beside myself throughout the entire experience.
                                <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?feature=shared">Ask my parents</a>: from day one I was ecstatic to be able to partake in the highest 
                                quality computer science education available in Switzerland, taught by professors who made significant contributions to the subject of 
                                their class (some of them even covering what they themselves discovered <span style="text-wrap: nowrap;">（ ๑✧∀✧๑ ）</span>).
                                Not without struggles and off-days, I worked diligently and always gave it my best, so even if I ended up failing, I'd have no regrets looking back, 
                                and three years later, as I'm writing this in August 2024, I am close enough to graduating that I can taste it, and it tastes like Rösti and Pastetli.

                                I was born in Luzern, Switzerland, and raised in Lugano. 
                                From a young age, I was fascinated by computers, sometimes getting to watch my dad build them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My love for video games like Sonic Adventure and Pokémon FireRed, and especially as I got older, 
                                taught me that games are an art form, capable of conveying powerful messages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my early teens, I got into YouTube, creating and editing videos and images, 
                                which gave me experience with software like Adobe Premiere Pro and Photoshop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After a percussion teacher visited my school, I became interested in music 
                                and started taking drumming lessons at age 11, continuing until I moved to Zürich at 20.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By the end of middle school, my interests in computers, video games, and 
                                creativity led to a passion for computer science, a field that I could both 
                                study and understand, and which allows me to create.
                            </p>

                        <section id="personal-history-detailed">
                            <p>
                                I was born at the age of -0.25 years in the city of Luzern (LU), Switzerland, 
                                and was transported back to Lugano (TI) a few months later, where I was raised.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Already from a very young age I found a deep interest in computers, with one of 
                                my earliest memory being helping my dad to build a computer for a customer 
                                (if by "helping" you mean holding the flashlight and staring in awe).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shortly thereafter, I discovered the wonderful rabbithole that is ✨video games✨: 
                                Sonic Adventure, Pokémon FireRed, Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda, Banjo-Kazooie, The Sims, 
                                and so many more... I received a modest PC from my father, and I spent most of my free time on it 
                                (usually causing damage), and I have since discovered, especially getting older, that video games 
                                could not only entertain and waste time, but send a deeply powerful message, evoke emotions in the 
                                player, and create a lasting impact on them. Video games are not just another mindless activity, I found. 
                                They are a form of art.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, in my early teenage years, when being a YouTuber was slowly becoming a viable carreer choice, 
                                I was caught into the YouTube fame whirlwind. I started creating and editing audio, videos and images, 
                                and showing them to friends and family. This gave me plenty of hours of experience during which I have 
                                taught myself how to use all manners of editing software, including Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe 
                                Photoshop. I continued for about 7 years, excited about the possibility to entertain myself and others 
                                by just doing what I loved. I was hooked on the possibility of creating very real ties with people 
                                from faraway places by just being myself.

                                After a percussions teacher visited us in elementary school, I became curious about music and rhythm. 
                                My father has always been the music lover in the family, and I grew up overhearing the countless genres 
                                and styles coming from his speakers, but at that point I saw that there was something special about music, 
                                so I asked my parents if I could take drumming lessons.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                Let me tell you, the voyage I have been on since I started playing music led me to discover the joy 
                                that is music, not just as a listener, where of course you can form a tie by relating to the emotions 
                                that surround the artist once they step on stage, but also as a performer, where you can send out a 
                                figurative message in a bottle, and whoever relates to it can choose to stick around, and for a split 
                                second a very powerful link is formed. There are few better feelings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And, in case you were wondering, I started learning music at 11 years of age, and I only stopped before 
                                moving to Zürich, when I was 20 years old. Playing however... That, I just can't bring myself to stop ;)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, in the last few years of middle school, all these aspects converged, and the influence I received
                                from that magical black box under my desk culminated into a passion for computer science: a discipline that 
                                would allow me to study how the PC, which brought me countless hours of fun and entertainment, actually functioned, 
                                and, even more importantly, how to use it to create something that could be useful or entertaining for others. 
                                I think computer science can be a form of art: it can help you fulfil a vision, share your story with the world, 
                                provide everyone with something you feel society is missing, and if people relate they can stick around.

                        <p>The most burning goal at the moment is making sure to graduate from my bachelor's degree. It would be nice to see the fruit of 3 years of <i>HARD</i> work.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise I would love to learn how to play piano and guitar well enough to be able to perform at least in front of friends and family.</p>
                        <p>Slightly more long-term, I would love to design and develop a video game from the start until the moment I feel comfortable calling it finished. Not necessarily publishing it, just "making" a video game, for the satisfaction of giving back to the gaming community, which has given so much to me throughout the years.</p>
