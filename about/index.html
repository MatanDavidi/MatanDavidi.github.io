    <h1>About me works!</h1>
    <!-- Structure:
    - Personal/professional history (born, raised, passion for video games, passion for CS, passion for music; where studied and what, "for more about me from a professional point of view, see <a href="cv.html">CV</a> ")
    - What I enjoy doing in my free time (music, video games [first ever was Sanic, will never forget my first Nintendo Wii, went through Undertale phase, played Hollow Knight to 99% completion, still have to complete Hades' storyline, now favourite is Shantae], tv shows/anime, etc.)
    - What I want to learn (GAME DESIGN; as much as possible about CS; piano, singing)
    - Plan in life (Finish my CS Bachelor's, follow up with a CS Master's, work for a few years to make enough money, Uppsala [Staffordshire?]) -->
